<h2>Inspiration for this Talk</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This Talk was inspired by Fireship.io</li>
    <li>He made a very thought provoking video about tech stack layers</li>
    <li>We Won't Go into it, but it got me thinking</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Am I Overcomplicating My Projects?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm A DevOps Engineer by trade</li>
        <li>I <em>should</em> always be looking for the simplest solutions</li>
    </ul>

<h2>The Mean,Green, Lean Machine</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I want to examine, closely, 2 principles from Lean management</li>
    <li>Defining Value : Clearly define what the value is to your upstream; remove anything else that does not create this value</li>
    <li>Persuit of Perfection : Perfection is a path, not a reachable goal; start with good and move to better</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Defining Value</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lets Start with a 2 Simple Questions</li>
        <li>Does our upstream <em>actually</em> care what technology we use?</li>
        <li>Does our upstream <em>actually</em> get value from this technology</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
      <h2>Defining Value</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More often than not, the answer is a resounding No</li>
        <li>In Fact, in most cases, our end-user isn't even made aware of the tech we use</li>  
      </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Defining Value</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the biggest pitfalls when defining value is not being user-centric</li>
        <li>Which, in turn, leads to stack selection that is not based on real user value</li>
        <li>Leading to overcomplicating our work, trying to get around technology opinions, pitfalls, and usage</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Defining Value</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Then it stands to reason then, that we should be looking for the simplest, most effective technology to do a task</li>
        <li>And this technology we choose, should be
            <ul>
                <li>Self-Contained : It does not pollute other tasks</li>
                <li>Specialized : Performs its job to the maximum</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Defining Value</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frameworks are Great - Don't Get me wrong</li>
        <li>But More often than not, frameworks are chosen at the start of project's life</li>
        <li>And that Decision is expensive to revert - and will only show it's pitfalls as the project grows</li>
        <li>And we rarely use the majority of them</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Persuit of Perfection</h2>
    <h3>"Have no fear of perfection - you'll never reach it." - Salvador Dali</h3>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Persuit of Perfection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We should always be refining our craft</li>
        <li>Refining our Craft, and Our Product, means that we need flexebility</li>
        <li>It also means we need to be able to switch out technologies, or at the very least, not be tied into certain opinions</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Persuit of Perfection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the biggest issues of frameworks is that you will only work the way the framework wants you to</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Modular Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The World is full of simple, consince, libraries</li>
        <li>Evaluate each technology on its own; each library as it fits into the whole</li>
        <li>Use Them!</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>A Modular Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Quantitative and Qualitative Methods</li>
        <li>Think as a Client; As a User, what would create value for me</li>
    </ul>
