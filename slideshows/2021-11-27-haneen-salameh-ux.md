        <ul>
            <li>Not an OS process</li>
            <li>A very small piece of sequential code</li>
            <li>Elixir is functional in this context, but not pure</li>

        <p>“Don’t ever think your job is just to
            provide solutions. Anyone can come up
            with a solution given a pen and a
            whiteboard. You’ll be hired because
            you have the skills to best comprehend
            and communicate the situation.”
